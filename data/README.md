# Data

Anthropogenic global warming and climate change are long term topics of concern. 

Weather data and climate data is a first class topic of concern.

Data kinds
* Climate, backward looking - centuries millenia age/stage epoch/series ..., forward looking - far time projections years decades centuries millennia,
* Weather, backward looking - years decades centuries, forward looking - near time projections days weeks months years
* Atmospheric, gas phase
* Oceanic, liquid phase
* Lithographic, solid phase
* Cryospheric, solid phase
* Biospheric, phases? sinks, absorbtion, emmision, 
* Anthrospheric, emmision, storage, transformation, 
* Metadata
* Reference
* Series, time series weather/climate
* Pipeline, data transformation protocols for eea and like topics of concern 
* ...

## Status

TODO
* <todo: create projects per data type identified >
* <todo: consider better name than Series? time series weather/climate, not to confuse it with epoch/series? consult Met Office WMO WWA >
* <todo: consider moving data related concerns from other project here, for example eea datapiplines for statistical climatology >
* <todo: consider, first cut pull services to access data storage sites, RESTful, JSON, other? implies Java project, polling? probably only to dedicated notification resources,  >
* <todo: consider, first cut alert services to warn of unusal readings from data storage sites, RESTful, JSON, other? implies Java project, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit >
* <done: RDF metadata started >
