# Medicine and Public Health mph

Population wide medicine and public health impacts of global warming, local, regional, global. 

Public health requires its own meteorological data and pipelines. A number of linked public health specific meso meteorological station networks. Earth observation and meteorological data gathering specifically tailored to public health.

For example;
* specific site locale's of particular epidemiological concern.
* 

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, contact World Health Organisation WHO for meteorological data requirements, cite paper ISSN 0013-9351, >
* <todo: consider AnthropogenicAdaptiveMedicine interface, another name AnthropogenicPreventiveMedicine, probably not needed at this piont? >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
* <done: consider, AnthropogenicPublicHealth interface, wip, iterate; method declarations, constants, api, >

Methods/protocols
* Hierarchy of evidence, levels of evidence LOEs,  evidence levels ELs, 
* Dependent variable, e.g. lung cancer, global warming/climate change, 
* Independent variable, e.g. smoking (burning tobacco), anthropogenic green house gas emissions (burning fossil fuels),  
* Statistical significance, 
* Odds ratio OR, 
* Relative risk RR, 
* Risk factor RF, 
* Ethic standards, known risk factors, unethical to perform RCTs or PCS in cases where the outcome is known, induce smoking to prove caused lung cancer, exposure to sun/uv to prove caused skin cancer, induce drug dependency to prove caused addiction co-morbideties or mortality, prescribe medication to prove caused side effect co-morbidities or mortality, burn fossil fuels to prove caused anthropogenic global warming/climate change co-morbidities or mortality,
