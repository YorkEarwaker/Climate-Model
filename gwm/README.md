# Global warming model gwm

SimpleGlobaWarmingModel as first iteration.

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider CGWL Met Office blended as part of SimpleGlobaWarmingModel >
* <todo: source two other papers cited in Met Office Nature 1 Dec 2023, re different GWL metric approaches, links broken in paper contact MO for links >
* <todo: consider CO2, CH4 and N2O parts per million, start with service data retrieval, which org end point resources to get the data from? >
* <todo: consider, RegionalWarmingModel, interface, >

DONE
* <done: org\aga\gwm package dir structure >
* <done: start of interface design and interface classes in org\agw\gwm package >
* <done: consider GWL interface IPCC approach, stubb created >
* <done: consider CGWL interface, Met Office blended IPCC compliant apporach, stubb created >
* <done: abstract class? or interface default implemention? for GWL and CGWL for common implenentation capabiliity. likley interface default, >
