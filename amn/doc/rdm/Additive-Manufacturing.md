## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, 3d printer, which printer and resin for which use case? >
* <todo: consider, 3d design software, CAD, other 3d modeller? >
* <todo: consider, scale, from very small micro/nano to very large macro say house, start with meso weather station component parts, >
* <todo: consider, how to make 3d printing wherever possible eco friendly, i.e. cut down on plastics? but make long lasting? is this an impossible ask for \adm, >
* <todo: consider, repository for 3d designs, >

Done
