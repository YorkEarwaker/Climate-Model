# Research development & manufacturing rdm

Making of physical artifacts as part of production process in for example weather station devices and instrumentation, . Assembly line instruction for example for an entire weather station unit. With assembly of third party components like RPi and sensors with additive manufacturing parts created on site.

Continuous process manufacturing in regard to time series data as good production from natural physical resource variables. The good in the weather station use case is the time series data. The weather station device parts and instrument parts the means of production of time series date good product.

The manufacture of weather station wholes and replacement parts, or new parts, or improved parts, or specialised parts, or bespoke parts. The means to time series data good product. ...

The time series good product an open source free to use data set for humanity for climate change systems management. Like numerical climate/weather prediction model inputs.
