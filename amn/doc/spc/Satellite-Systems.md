# Satellite systems stl

Low cost tactical small/nano/micro satellites to monitor specific meteorological concners.

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, bom for PoC, MVP, sensor? vision? light? >
* <todo: consider, small, nano, micro, cube, for observation of specific concerns, glacial lake monitoring, green wall Sub Sahara, Pantanall wildfire, etc, >
* <todo: consider, Copernicus, EU Space, UK Space, AU Space?, JP Space, for launch, >
* <todo: consider, new launch sites in say Madagasgar? bespoke tbd launch system RYO? >
* <todo: consider benefits of replacing Raspbian Debian with Ubuntu for sat on board units? impacts other projects too, >
* <todo: consider, Ubuntu Appliance portfolio, images for amn, what does that look like, >
* <todo: consider, comms satellite, amn-link?, amn-coms?, spc-net?, space hub and spoke down link/up link?, wide area network?, wifi?, amn satellite intranet, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
* <done: consider, separate base station sub project, satellite tracker, data download, comms, base-systems.md started, >
