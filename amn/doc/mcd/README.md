# Measurement, control, data, mcd

Metrics and telemetry, data logging and storage, . 

What other variables and metrics might be included in a amn unit? Over and above standard meterological ones. Detection of gases, particles and particulates, microbiome, chemical molecules, and so on. Likely on a per use case and scenario basis. 

Modular system of systems approach to ensure pick and mix observational tools and instruments. Where over a certain limit, to be defined, for arguments sake say ten, move from small unit size to medeim unit size. The limit of ten being entirely arbitrary. 

The standard height for measurement is set at two meters for meterological data for wind speed for example. What might a different suite of such requirements look like? Which bodies would be responsible for setting them? WMO and which others? Industry bodies? Gov bodies? NMHSs? NGOs? ... That is which are the set of stakeholder groups to canvas for respective concerns.  

Depiction of overlap of stakeholder concerns via; grid, heatmap, Euler diagram, other . Cross section comparative analysis of measurement suites per stakeholder. Use cases for fixed station sites for longer term time series data for extreme event attribution. Use cases for portable station sites for shorter term time series data for public health and epidemiology. A mixture of fixed stations sites and portable station sites both marine based and land based might also be appropriate for environment agencies in for example monitoring coastal errosion accelerated by rising sea levels. For example fixed bouys might after fifty years, or less, be further from the shoreline than when first installed. Additional bouys might be installed closer to the receded shoreline.

Another use case for portable station might the study of predicted extreme weather. Bouys put in line of hurricane. Which would be hazard work. Due to unpredictability of tacking as shown by spaghetti graphs. This might also be the case for typhoon landfall. And other project extreme events, heat and wet bulb events, precipitation events, wind events, drought events, and so on.

Portable stations for epidemiological monitoring of camps of displaced people. Climate refugees, conflict refugees, economic migrants, and so on.

## Standards

Data device 
* ITR-R V.24
* ITU-R-V.28
* others to source

Connector
* USB? would this be robust enough, get loose under stressed conditions, 
* RS-?, would a pin based connector be better, harder to dislodge under stress conditions, 
* other
