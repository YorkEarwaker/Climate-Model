# Measurement, control, data, mcd

Metrics and telemetry, data logging and storage, . 

What other variables and metrics might be included in a amn unit? Over and above standard meterological ones. Detection of gases, particles and particulates, microbiome, chemical molecules, and so on. Likely on a per use case and scenario basis. 

Modular system of systems approach to ensure pick and mix observational tools and instruments. Where over a certain limit, to be defined, for arguments sake say ten, move from small unit size to medium unit size. The limit of ten being entirely arbitrary. Or upper limits might be; small might have five instruments, medium five to fifteen instruments, large fifteen and above, again purely arbitrary sizing exercise as initial stake in the ground. 

The standard height for measurement is set at two meters for meterological data for wind speed for example. What might a different suite of such requirements look like? Which bodies would be responsible for setting them? WMO and which others? Industry bodies? Gov bodies? NMHSs? NGOs? ... That is which are the set of stakeholder groups to canvas for respective concerns.  

Depiction of overlap of stakeholder concerns via; grid, heatmap, Euler diagram, other . Cross section comparative analysis of measurement suites per stakeholder. Use cases for fixed station sites for longer term time series data for extreme event attribution. Use cases for portable station sites for shorter term time series data for public health and epidemiology. A mixture of fixed stations sites and portable station sites both marine based and land based might also be appropriate for environment agencies in for example monitoring coastal errosion accelerated by rising sea levels. For example fixed bouys might after fifty years, or less, be further from the shoreline than when first installed. Additional bouys might be installed closer to the receded shoreline.

Another use case for portable station might the study of predicted extreme weather. Bouys put in line of hurricane. Which would be hazard work. Due to unpredictability of tacking as shown by spaghetti graphs. This might also be the case for typhoon landfall. And other project extreme events, heat and wet bulb events, precipitation events, wind events, drought events, and so on.

Portable stations would also be an useful capability in response to extreme events. And ongoing emergency management response and recovery events.

One roll out option of more permanent fix station units might be in sites where extreme events have occurred and are predicted to reoccur in the years and decades to come. So given assumption that instrumentation measurement and data validation is the same for portable and fixed units fixed units could replace portable units. <todo: consider moving this para to main amn README.md >

One parallel piece of work is in coordination with WMO and NMHS and other stakeholders like public health and global health for prospective sites for a roll out of fixed station sites. Another would be working with private sector and NGO stakeholders for industry specific roll out programme. The private sector initiatives might help finance the public health initiatives for example. <todo: consider moving this para to main amn README.md >

Portable stations for epidemiological monitoring of camps of displaced people. Climate refugees, conflict refugees, economic migrants, and so on.

* ITR-R V.24
* ITU-R-V.28
* others to source

Connector
* USB? would this be robust enough, get loose under stressed conditions, 
* RS-?, would a pin based connector be better, harder to dislodge under stress conditions,
