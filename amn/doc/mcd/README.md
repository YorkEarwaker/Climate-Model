* <todo: are these the correct standards to use? ITR-R V.24, V.28, , are these superseded? current? deprecated?  >

DONE

## Standards

Data device 
* ITR-R V.24
* ITU-R-V.28
* others to source

Connector
* USB? would this be robust enough, get loose under stressed conditions, 
* RS-?, would a pin based connector be better, harder to dislodge under stress conditions, 
* other
