Power supply for mcd component modules, microcontroller boards, single computer boards, analogue peripherals, sensors, . 

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, power consumption for micorocontorller board/single coputer board and analogue peripherals, sensors>
* <todo: consider, power per deployment scenario, remote deployment renewable and rechargeable battery, grid access>
* <todo: consider, different renewable power generation options; solar, wind, wave (bouys), >
* <todo: consider, hydrogen, fuel cell, >
* <todo: consider, rechargeable battery, paired with renewable source, >
* <todo: consider, solar will only function at 60 due to surface contamination, dust, pollen, consider self cleaning mechanisms and coatings for panel to prohibit mold and so on, >
* <todo: consider, maintenance schedule, >
* <todo: consider, sonic vibration to dispel dust, pollen, from surface of solar panel >
* <todo: consider, solar panel or solar skin, photovoltaic, first renewable power unit, first iteration >
* <todo: consider, rechargeable battery, first iteration, >
* <todo: consider, separate repository for renewable energy technology unit, mixed energy generationg base, hybrid renewable energy unit, hybrid reu to produce hydrogen for combined energy generation unit, micro combined heat and power fuel cells, >
* <todo: consider, power consumption for small units to be fairly low as mcd modules will be in sleep mode for most to the time, sleep mode between synopic sensor reading windows, network connection modules might be separate component units aka SCB,  >
* <todo: consider, will some sensors, as component modules have separate batteries as part of manufacturer spec, ? >
* <todo: consider, bench power supply unit for research and development, circuit testing,  >
* <todo: consider, integrated into circuit board and also as separate unit interface to power supply for all power consumption?>

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
