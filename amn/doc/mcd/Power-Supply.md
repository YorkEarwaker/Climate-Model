# Power supply psl

Power supply for mcd component modules, microcontroller boards, single computer boards, analogue peripherals, sensors, . 

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, power consumption for micorocontorller board/single coputer board and analogue peripherals, sensors>
* <todo: consider, power per deployment scenario, remote deployment renewable and rechargeable battery, grid access>
* <todo: consider, different renewable power generation options; solar, wind, wave (bouys), >
* <todo: consider, hydrogen, >
* <todo: consider, rechargeable battery, paired with renewable source, >
* <todo: consider, solar will only function at 60 due to surface contamination, dust, pollen, consider self cleaning mechanisms and coatings for panel to prohibit mold and so on, >
* <todo: consider, maintenance schedule, >
* <todo: consider, sonic vibration to dispel dust, pollen, from surface of solar panel >
* <todo: consider, solar panel or solar skin, photovoltaic, first renewable power unit, first iteration >
* <todo: consider, rechargeable battery, first iteration, >
* <todo: consider, separate repository for renewable energy technology unit, mixed energy generationg base, hybrid renewable energy unit, hybrid reu to produce hydrogen for combined energy generation unit, micro combined heat and power fuel cells, >


DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
