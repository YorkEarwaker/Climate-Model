# Autonomous meteorological network amn

Units oversight by local jurisdiction national meteorolgical and hydrological service NMHS. Unmanned technology systems. Synoptic? System of systems.

Meeting WMO standards. Land born units fixed s/m/l, water born units buoys, air born units weather balloons.

Weather/climate data is a first class topic of concern.

## Goals & Objectives

* Global warming data, global warming limits, planetary boundary science
* World Weather Attribution data, extreme event attribution
* Extreme event emergency reponse and management data
* Planning data, mitigation, adaptation, civil engineering, 
* Future proofing adaptation
* Strategic resilliency 
* Global weather knows no borders
* Open source for complete transparency
* UN SDG's
* Development assistance

## Status

TODO
* <todo: research, >
* <todo: contact WMO >
* <todo: first itertion land born units, small, mediumm, large, small priority? check priority stakeholder group, assume small yes to avoid analysis parallysis, >
* <todo: parallel workstreams land, water, air, >
* <todo: Autonomous Meteorological Network, placeholder name, project name tbc, aws autonomous/automated weather station? wsn weather station network? msn meteorological station network? gmn global meterological network? other name?  >
* <todo: consider base instrumentation, Thermometer (air/sea surface temperature), Barometer (air pressure), Hygrometer (humidity), Anemometer (wind speed), Pyranometer (solar radiation), Rain guage (precipitation), Wind vane (wind direction), ceilometer (cloud height), present weather sensor/visibility sensor, ultrasonic snow depth sensor, Evaporation pan, others. Which are core base which are specific to context? >
* <todo: consider C++ repository structure, as this will be systems engineering; hardward, firmware, . some server side application code telemetry data processing, may require java code base, & web front end, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit >
