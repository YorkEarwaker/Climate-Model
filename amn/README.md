# Autonomous meteorological network amn

Units oversight by local jurisdiction national meteorolgical and hydrological service NMHS. In coordination with other stakeholders; public health, environment agency, transport agency, agriculture agency, metropolitan agency, and so on. Specific stakeholder sites of interest. Unmanned technology systems. Synoptic six hourly, hourly, other temporal resolution time measure metric. System of systems. Local, regional, and global systems management.

Meeting WMO standards. Other standard sub sets, yet to be defined, for specific stakeholder group concerns. Standards deltas from WMO base station optimal might be on a; per observational instrument unit basis, or use case scenario basis, or industry vertical basis, ? 

Land born units fixed s/m/l, water born units buoys, air born units weather balloons. Likely meso amn's for different concerns of diverse stakeholder groups. For example, meso networks for; public health and epidemiology, micro climates of large urban centres, transport (road, rail, air, marine, ) infrastructure network, agricultural irrigation network, telco network, energy (electric, hydrogen, fossil, ) network, and so on.

Weather/climate data is a first class topic of concern.

## Status

TODO
* <todo: research, >
* <todo: contact WMO >
* <todo: first itertion land born units, small, mediumm, large, small priority? check priority stakeholder group, assume small yes to avoid analysis parallysis, >
* <todo: parallel workstreams land, water, air, >
* <todo: Autonomous Meteorological Network, placeholder name, project name tbc, aws autonomous/automated weather station? wsn weather station network? msn meteorological station network? gmn global meterological network? other name?  >
* <todo: consider base instrumentation, Thermometer (air/sea surface temperature), Barometer (air pressure), Hydrometer (humidity), Anemometer (wind speed), Pyranometer (solar radiation), Rain guage (precipitation), Wind vane (wind direction), ceilometer (cloud height), present weather sensor/visibility sensor, ultrasonic snow depth sensor, Evaporation pan, others. Which are core base which are specific to context? >
* <todo: consider C++ repository structure, as this will be systems engineering; hardward, firmware, . some server side application code telemetry data processing, may require java code base, & web front end, >
* <todo: consider, several sub-directories to amn project if multiple code bases are required, >
* <todo: consider, similar objectives, autonomous atmospheric network aan, at varous heights in the gas phase column, gasses, aerosols, particulates, spectroscopy, high altitude airship/balloon h = P_0/ρg, h is altutude, P_0 initial pressure, ρ is air density, g is acceleration due to gravity, weather and environmental monitoring >
* <todo: consider, similar objectives, autonomous oceanic network aon, at varous depths in the liquid phase column, disolved gasses, temperature, flows, biome, Bathyscaphe, >
* <todo: consider, radiosondes, telemetry instrument that measures atmospheric variables and transmits them to the ground, battery powered, balloon lift, >
* <todo: consider, METAR every hour, SYNOP every six hours, and other report standards, >
* <todo: consider, station-based validation data, NFRs; completeness, availability, >
* <todo: consider, measurement and control module, data logger, like; Campbell Scientific CR10X,  >
* <todo: consider, power energy requirements, sml station base, battery, solar, wind, hydro, hydrogen, local grid (if available), >
* <todo: consider standards WMO concern delta mitigation, unit basis, scenario basis, other basis, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit >
* <done: consider OSGi repository structure, as this will be an IIoT systems engineering; . Will not better allow for multiple code bases, OSGi for implementation in Java centric projects, Apache Celix for OSGi implementation for C/C++ centric projects, >
