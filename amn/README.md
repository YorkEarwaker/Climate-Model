# Autonomous meteorological network amn

Units oversight by local jurisdiction national meteorolgical and hydrological service NMHS. Unmanned technology systems. Synoptic? System of systems. Global systems management.

Meeting WMO standards. Land born units fixed s/m/l, water born units buoys, air born units weather balloons. Likely meso amn's for different concerns of diverse stakeholder groups.

Weather/climate data is a first class topic of concern.

## Goals & Objectives

* Global warming data, global warming limits, planetary boundary science
* World Weather Attribution data, extreme event attribution
* Extreme event emergency management response and recovery data
* Planning data, mitigation, adaptation, civil engineering, 
* Future proofing adaptation
* Strategic resilliency 
* Global weather knows no borders
* Open source for complete transparency
* UN SDG's
* Development assistance

## Status

TODO
* <todo: research, >
* <todo: contact WMO >
* <todo: first itertion land born units, small, mediumm, large, small priority? check priority stakeholder group, assume small yes to avoid analysis parallysis, >
* <todo: parallel workstreams land, water, air, >
* <todo: Autonomous Meteorological Network, placeholder name, project name tbc, aws autonomous/automated weather station? wsn weather station network? msn meteorological station network? gmn global meterological network? other name?  >
* <todo: consider base instrumentation, Thermometer (air/sea surface temperature), Barometer (air pressure), Hygrometer (humidity), Anemometer (wind speed), Pyranometer (solar radiation), Rain guage (precipitation), Wind vane (wind direction), ceilometer (cloud height), present weather sensor/visibility sensor, ultrasonic snow depth sensor, Evaporation pan, others. Which are core base which are specific to context? >
* <todo: consider C++ repository structure, as this will be systems engineering; hardward, firmware, . some server side application code telemetry data processing, may require java code base, & web front end, >
* <todo: consider, several sub-directories to amn project if multiple code bases are required, >
* <todo: consider, similar objectives, autonomous atmospheric network aan, at varous heights in the gas phase column, gasses, aerosols, particulates, spectroscopy, high altitude airship/balloon h = P_0/ρg, h is altutude, P_0 initial pressure, ρ is air density, g is acceleration due to gravity, weather and environmental monitoring >
* <todo: consider, similar objectives, autonomous oceanic network aon, at varous depths in the liquid phase column, disolved gasses, temperature, flows, biome, 	Bathyscaphe, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit >
* <done: consider OSGi repository structure, as this will be an IIoT systems engineering; . Will not better allow for multiple code bases, OSGi for implementaton in Java centric projects, Apache Celix for OSGi implenentation for C/C++ centric projects, >
