# Project and programme management ppm

Things related to product management and project management but not code development. Colocated with code when ppm is part of sme or startup.

## Notes

Local host stuff
* Java code for Climate Model is held in, Elicpse Workspace, \eclipse-workspace-2024S
* Other code and artifacts for Climate Model is held in, Repo, \dev\repo

## Status

TOD0
* <todo: consider, move Eclipse Workspace \eclipse-workspace-2024S, to \dev\eclipse-workspace-2024S, >
* <todo: pid>
* <todo: create additional sub directories as needed for better file organisation, >
* <todo: select a ppm approach, agile product management, agile project management, PMBoK, PPMI, Prince2, etc >
* <todo: test if this is a good approach to manage all projects >
* <todo: consider, moving todo list from top level repo README.md here? >
* <todo: consider, Ubuntu, OpenStack and Kubernetes as part of default technology stack, Canonical default, >
* <todo: consider, Ubuntu, IoT for Raspberry Pi SCB, https://ubuntu.com/certified/iot?offset=80 >
* <todo: consider, Ubuntu, LTS release is tabled for 24 April 2025?, 24.10 (Oracular Oriole) wait for point release? https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle sourced 17/03/2025, it might be better to wait and go for point release? or start with LTS '24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)' as LTS release cycle is every two years, so next LTS 24 April 2026? confused about best approach, likely best create bootable USB with '24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)' for clean upgrade path, >
