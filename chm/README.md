Chemistry based capability. 

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, chemical elements, particularly those in relation to anthropogenic global warming, >
* <todo: consider, periodic table, class, >
* <todo: consider, content for Element interface, >
* <todo: consider, content for Molecule interface, >
* <todo: consider, create ChemicalSubstance interface, name just Substance or ChemicalSubstance?>
* <todo: consider, content for ChemicalSubstance interface,  >
* <todo: consider, create Compound interface, >
* <todo: consider, arguments/parameters for Element Records, >
* <todo: consider, arguments/parameters for Molecule Records, >
* <todo: consider, should Things currently under \mcl inherit Compound instead of Molecule? rename package? bike shedding?>
* <todo: consider, complete creation of all remaining elements in periodic table, >


DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
* <done: consider, use Java Record as data holding structure for element information, implement Element interface, wip >
* <done: consider, create Element interface, >
* <deon: consider, create Molecule interface, >
* <done: consider, random selection of elements to start to build toward periodic table completeness, at least one from each block, s-block, f-block, d-block, p-block, >
