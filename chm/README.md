TODO
* <todo: consider, chemical elements, particularly those in relation to anthropogenic global warming, >
* <todo: consider, periodic table, class, >
* <todo: consider, content for Element interface, >
* <todo: consider, content for Molecule interface, >
* <todo: consider, create ChemicalSubstance interface, name just Substance or ChemicalSubstance?>

* <todo: consider, create Compound interface, >
* <todo: consider, arguments/parameters for Element Records, >
* <todo: consider, arguments/parameters for Molecule Records, >
* <todo: consider, should Things currently under \mcl inherit Compound instead of Molecule? rename package? bike shedding?>
* <todo: consider, complete creation of all remaining elements in periodic table, >
* <todo: consider, subpackage org\agw\chm\ptb periodic table, interfaces Group, Period, Block, >
* <todo: consider, \ptb interface or collection or other, Primordial, DecayProduct, Synthetic, ponder more, >
* <todo: consider, g-block, h-block, period 8, period 9, ... consider chm\elm\thr theoretical, or chm\elm\ext extended, or chm\elm\ept extendend periodic table, or chm\elm\hyp hypothetical, like hyp, ponder more, after organesson Z=118 element in period 7, >
* <todo: consider, argument 'String name', for name used for element for a particular instantiation of Element Record, >
* <todo: consider, not including in Element Record Block, Period, similar as these relate only to periodic table representation of chemical elements and are not specific to element, description of orbitals to be different, description of allotrope to Molecule only? isomers for Element? Should Allotrope be an interface itself taking as reference or argument Element Record, ? >
* <todo: consider, Anthropogenic for synthetic elements, could they appear elsewhere in the universe under natural conditions different from Earth? While most synthetics have an extremely short half life it does not preclude them from appearing in nature under the right conditions outside of the laboratory somewhere in the universe, supernova for example, even if the decay quickly afterward, >

As environmental shifts accelerate extreme fire conditions and communities expand into fire-prone landscapes, these devastating wildfires are becoming more common.
