# Extreme event attribution eea

Extreme weather event attribution as they occure in the present. Past event attribution to out of holocine climate conditions at the time. Preditcion of future extreme weather event prediciton on scenario conditions. Prediction of new kinds of as yet unexperienced extreme weather events.

An attempt toward some means of automation. Operationalization.

Events like; convective storms, extra-tropical cylones, tropical cyclones, precipitation, drought, heat, snow and ice, cold, ...

Effects like, amoungs others; climate refugees, climate migration, wet bulb event organ failure deaths, flood drowning deaths, fire burns deaths, infrastructure failure/damage/destruction, algal blooms, outgassing, marine life die off, famine, flood, fire wildfires,/urban-firestorms, conflict, ...

## Status

TODO
* <todo: upload first module core, java directory source structure>
* <todo: look at Imperial web site, EEA collateral, >
* <todo: email Imperial EEA team, inquire where it might be possible to contribute, >
* <todo: use of gai as means of interpretation reasoning, creation of gai capability a seperate project/programme, >
* <todo: create boscard >
* <todo: consider org\agw\eea AnthropogenicEventAttribution interface >
* <todo: obervational data aquisition for analysis, reliability issues, homogeneity issues, missing data gap issues, etc  . requirement for protocols, requirements for seperate project UN WWO working with partners like WWA and others to create 'reliable off the shelf' data set avaiable, local regional gobal, for eea efforts and others, data is a first class issue, >
* <todo: requirement, observational data, long time series up to and including the event, >
* <todo: statistical analysis of data, methods, protocols, processes, activities, tasks, workflow, >
* 

DONE
* <done: Intent to start, >
