# Extreme event attribution eea

Extreme weather event attribution as they occure in the present. Past event attribution to out of holocine climate conditions at the time. Preditcion of future extreme weather event prediciton on scenario conditions. Prediction of new kinds of as yet unexperienced extreme weather events.

An attempt toward some means of automation. 

Events like; convective storms, extra-tropical cylones, tropical cyclones, presipitation, drought, heat, snow and ice, cold, ...

Effects like, amoungs others; climate refugees, climate migration, wet bulb event organ failure deaths, flood drowning deaths, fire burns deaths, infrastructure failure/damage/destruction, algal blooms, outgassing, marine life die off, famine, flood, fire wildfires,/urban-firestorms,  conflict, ...
