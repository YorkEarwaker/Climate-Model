Gatekeeping material reality is a prerequisite for safeguarding people

Gatekeeping material reality and safeguarding people is a prerequisite for conserving civilisation

A = Gatekeeping material reality

B = Safeguarding people

C = Conserving civilisation

If A then B - logic, material conditional

| A | B | A -> B | comment |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :---- |
| F | F | T | modes tollens |
| F | T | T | vacuous truth |
| T | F | F | common sense? |
| T | T | T | modes ponens |

If A then B - digital logic, imply gate

| A | B | A -> B |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Note. 
* Gatekeeping material reality is a process every person must participate in.
* Gatekeeping is not an elite activity.
* Gatekeeping as mass participation is the basis of democracy.
* Conserving as in conservation work.
* < todo: consider another term other than conserving; sustaining as in sustainability, preserving, maintaining, managing as in steady state, >
