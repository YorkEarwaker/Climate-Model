Gatekeeping material reality is a prerequisite for safeguarding people

Gatekeeping material reality and safeguarding people is a prerequisite for conserving civilisation

A = Gatekeeping material reality

B = Safeguarding people

C = Conserving civilisation

If A then B - logic, material conditional

| A | B | A -> B | comment |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :---- |
| F | F | T | modes tollens |
| F | T | T | vacuous truth |
| T | F | F | common sense? |
| T | T | T | modes ponens |

If A then B - digital logic, imply gate

| A | B | A -> B |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

What matters in this case is material reality. What is actually the case. What is the evidence, derived from the disinterested application of the scientific method, as facts of actuality. That is what is the disinterested scientific evidence regarding the facts of material reality. That is both valid and sound. That is facts that are materially conditional in gatekeeping material reality. That is gatekeeping material reality is conditional, a prerquisite, for safeguarding people. So that gatekeeping material reality and safeguarging people is conditional, a prerequisite, for conserving civilisation.

Forcasting based on past empirical evidence that is on a posteriori knowledge. Forcasting that is materially conditional in decision making bounded by gatekeeping material reality. Steady state management is conditional on forcasting for decsion making bounded by gatekeeping material reality. 

Note. 
* Gatekeeping material reality is a process every person must participate in.
* Gatekeeping is not an elite activity.
* Gatekeeping as mass participation is the basis of democracy.
* Conserving as in conservation work.
* < todo: consider another term other than conserving; sustaining as in sustainability, preserving, maintaining, managing as in steady state, >

## Status

TODO
* <todo: iterate project, global warming model, gwm, first instance simple global warming model, look to Grantham and Met Office for guidance, Reading? others? >
* <todo: iterate project, extreme event attribution, eea, look to Imperial and Met Office for guidance,  >
* <todo: consider org\agw\med for medical impacts, health effects, injuries, fatalities, epidemiology, a metric of severity, separate project? likely separate. >
* <todo: consider org\agw\phy for physics, climate, weather, extreme events, ... separate project? third party libraries to use? >
* <todo: consider org\agw\ecn for economic impacts, use doughnut economics, un sdg's, climate scorpion actuarial risk, rea accounting ontology model,  >
* <todo: consider org\agw\ele for extinction level events, anthropogenic climate change related, other non ACC events, tipping points, the event (straw) that broke the steady state Earth (camels back) scenarios, relation to all but particularly planet boundry limits,  >
* <todo: consider org\agw\eco package for ecological capability, eco impacts, >
* <todo: consider is eco also bio? or seperate bio package? biome biosphere >
* <todo: consider, org\agw\geo\gts refactor reference Ma value from SI capability org\agw\mth\siu package >
* <todo: consider org\agw\geo jar for lib dir's of other modules geo-api.jar >
* <todo: consider Manifest contents for META-INF? org\agw\geo jar geo-api.jar >
* <todo: consider generics, method parameter arguments, method return arguments, >
* <todo: consisder, org\agw\e2r emergency response & recovery package, emergency services, health services, environment servcies, national meteorological & hydrological services, . name package emr emergency managemet response & recovery, likley emr over e2r >
* <todo: consider, urban planning, org\agw\flw package >
* <todo: consider, civil engineering, org\agw\cng package related to but different from urban planning package, should this be \eng engineering and civil engineering appears as a sub package org\awg\eng\civ liking this approach better >
* <todo: consider, seperate climate org\agw\clm package to global warming model \gwm, unsure, >
* <todo: consider, seperate weather org\agw\wth package related to climate package there is likely to be a lot of overlap particularly in physics \phy and chemistry \chm >

DONE
* <done: first iteration readme, >
* <done: first iteration repository wiki, >
* <done: delete old java code directory structure, refactore as module based, for seperate code bases, >
* <done: select first project, consider extreme weather attribution (Imperial), selected>
* <done: consider org\agw\geo for geological capability, create Holocene >
* <done: refactor Athropocene to gts i.e. org\agw\geo\gts geological time scale package, >
* <done: consider org\agw\amn autonomous meteorological network, meteorological weather station units, inexpensive, deployed in the field for standard weather data recording, systems engineering, iot/iiot synoptic? >
* <done: consider moving some of the org\agw\gwm AnthropogenicThingThing.java to other use case specific packages where appliable >
* <done: consider org\agw\pbs package for planetary boundry science >
* <done: consider, DRY, refactor eea EventModel, gwm ClimateModel, to inherit from common interface as they have duplicate method definitions, space(), time(), model() >
* <done: consider, DRY, org\agw\mdl model based abstration, Model interface for inheritance by eea EventModel & gwm ClimateModel, >
* <done: consider, moving statistical things from Model mdl package to org\agw\mth\sta package, create new Mathematics projects >
