# Mathematics

Mathematical capability.

## Status

TODO
* <todo: Gaussian class concrete instance, try a number of different approaches, KIS(S) SEP, simplest first, >
* <todo: consider, Java Standard Library, e.g. java.util.Random  .nextGaussian, >
* <todo: consider, Apache Commons Math Library, e.g. org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.NormalDistribution; >
* <todo: consider, Apache Spark GaussianMixture, like this idea as it is a good excuse to use Spark, >
* <todo: consider, Discrete Gaussian Kernal, roll your own, the most fun due to the most to learn but the most daunting, not the simplest >
* <todo: consider, changeing package org\agw\mth\sta statistics to org\agw\mth\exp exponentiation >


DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
* <done: first use case selected eea Gaussian model https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-6-177-2020 , likely lots of reuse in other climate weather related capability >
* <done: use StatiticalModel and other interfaces to hid implementation details, SOLID SEP, wip >
* <done: GaussianStatisticalModel interface, started wip >
