# Climate model clm

Start at climate model. Related to weather model. Related to planetary boundary science.

Model contents include amoungst others;
* Physical principles, physical laws
* Variables, varients, of physical principles
* Constsants, invarients, of physical principles
* Parameterization, various systems and cycles, physicl processes, physics, chemistry, geology, topogrophy, ...
* Computation for, numerical analysis, grid kinds, 

Will likely eventually be a multi code project.  

## Goals & Objectives

For achievement of goals <better terms needed?, does not put accross intent sufficiently well? >
* Numerical weather prediction NWP
* Unified climate and weather model 
* Unified Earth systems model, 
* Universal planetary systems model 

To better enable objectives
* Earth systems science, 
* Extreme event attribution, 
* Extreme event prediction, 
* Planetary boundary science, 
* Planetary solvancy, 
* Donught economics, 
* Risk management, 
* Adaptation, change management
* Managed retreat, change managment
* and so on and so forth
