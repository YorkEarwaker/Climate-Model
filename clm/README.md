# Climate model

Start at climate model. Related to weather model. Related to planetary boundary science.

Will likely eventually be a multi code project.  

## Status

TODO
* <todo: Start to model basic model components in Java,  >
* <todo: consider which of the model parts would best sit in physics \phy some of which would be shared by weather \wth model >
* <todo: consider which of the model parts would be shared with weather model \wth >
* <todo: consider, start with seven physical principles of climate model >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
