# Extinction level event ele

Major harm to human civilisation or end to a planetary environment able to support humanity. Tipping points, the event (straw) that broke the steady state Earth (camels back) scenarios . 

Anthropogenic global warming and resulting anthropogenic climate change are one possible ele with specific impact of cascading systems effects. A global weather/climate system unsuitable for sustaining human life. The third mass extinction in biosphere. Global zoonotic transfer pandemic.  ...

## Status

TODO
* <todo: consider, tie to global warming/climate change concerns, \agw \eea \pbs etc,  >
* <todo: consider, source the EU equivalents of, JPL; Asteroid Watch, CNEOS, ? NASA PDCO? >
* <todo: consider, other countries with similar PDCO and like capability, AU, CN, IN, JP, others? >
* <todo: consider, AnthropognicExtinctionProcess interface or similar name, like anthropogenic global warming, third mass extinction biosphere die off, >

DONE
* <done: intent to commit>
